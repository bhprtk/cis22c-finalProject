# 👥 Friends — A Java-Based Social Network App

**Friends** is a social networking application built in Java, designed to explore and implement core data structures through real-world functionality. The app supports user authentication, search, friend recommendations, and basic messaging—demonstrating how data structures can power dynamic social interactions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication** — Powered by hash tables for fast credential lookup
- **User Search** — Implemented using binary search trees (BSTs) for efficient name or ID-based queries
- **Friend Recommendation** — Uses graph traversal (DFS and BFS) to suggest new friends based on mutual connections
- **Friend Management** — Linked lists maintain dynamic, modifiable friend lists
- **Messaging System** — Queues simulate basic message storage and delivery

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java  
- **Data Structures Used:**
  - Hash Tables
  - Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
  - Graphs (Adjacency List)
  - Linked Lists
  - Queues
- **Algorithms:** Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## 📈 Example Use Cases

- Register and log in as a user
- Search for other users in the network
- Get friend suggestions based on mutual connections
- Add and manage friends dynamically
- Send and queue messages between users

## 🧠 Key Concepts

This project demonstrates how core data structures can be applied to real-world problems. It serves as a practical example of how graph algorithms, search trees, and linear data structures can support user-driven applications like social networks.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add GUI using JavaFX or Swing
- Persistent storage (e.g., file or database)
- Real-time chat support
- Profile editing and activity feed
